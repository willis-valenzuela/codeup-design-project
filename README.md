Visual Design Project is a Single Page Application(SPA) developed with the sole purpose of informing the public of goods and services. 
The webpage is structured in a familiar brochure style format, including various illustrations, symbols, pictures, and text positioned 
at specific locations on various screens with the help of Bootstrap Grid & CSS Flexbox properties. The multitude of screen sizes all 
convey congruent information no matter the real estate of the screen managed by CSS media queries and Bootstrap 5 Breakpoints.
